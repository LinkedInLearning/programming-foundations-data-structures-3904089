## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to fundamental data structures, equipping you with the skills you need to implement and utilize arrays, lists, dictionaries, stacks, and queues effectively. Through hands-on exercises and real-world examples, instructor Kathryn Hodge shows you each of how these structures operate, including their efficiency in terms of time and space complexity. An ideal fit for learners new to programming, this course emphasizes practical applications, enabling you to solve common software problems such as searching, sorting, and data management. Additionally, you'll learn to analyze the trade-offs of different data structures and apply this knowledge to design scalable and efficient solutions. By the end of the course, you'll have the tools and know-how to start tackling complex programming challenges with confidence.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for some of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
